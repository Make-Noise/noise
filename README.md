# Noise

Blockchain technology enables us to do-ocraticly design new systems of human collaboration.

Today we live in communities of happenstance and duress. This situation ruins human potential. Working bottom up means returning to the axioms of what a community can be and writing anew. Can the life of a community be implemented in code? Working bottom-up with our new tools can we reimagine what a community can be and use this technology to subsume compromise and realize our ideals?

Noisebridge is a unique community whose culture uniquely positions it to conduct a communal experiment.

Noisebridge can use this technology to give its most excellent doocratic spirit wings.

How can anarchists uniquely wield this new tool and gift art to the world? Maybe with a tool like this we can get the whole world to make noise.

Some ways this can advance the community:

* Noisebridge’s Infrastructure is fractured, we can fix this by making it decentralized, a superior paradigm which reflects Noisebridge’s values
* Noisebridge is so much more than the space it occupies. We can use this new tool to powerfully extend what Noisebridge does outside of its Building #SpreadTheNoise
* Noisebridge has a ton of resources but a lot of them are lying undeployed. We can empower the community to doocratically use its resources to coordinate, act, and impact the world as a whole
* We can use people power to make Noisebridge’s financial challenges a thing of the past.
